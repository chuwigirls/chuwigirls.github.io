      </ul>

      <h2 id="compliance">2.0 Third-Party Compliance</h2>
      <p>Naras Nature is playable only via joining the Discord server, being personally 
        verified by the moderators, and then by authorizing your Discord account on 
        this website. In this way, all users of Naras Nature must comply with 
        <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord's terms.</a>
      </p>

        <h3 id="age">2.1 Age Requirements</h3>
        <p>In compliance with Discord's terms, all Civilians of Naras Nature must be 
          13 years of age or older to access gameplay.
        </p>
        <p>In compliance with <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/paypal/useragreement-full">
          Paypal's terms,</a> Civilians who are residents of the United States must 
          be 18 years or older to be able to open a U.S. PayPal account and 
          use its services. Naras Nature does not allow underage users to advertise 
          or process services using PayPal within the group. 
        </p>

        <h3 id="thirdparty">2.2 Third-Party Use</h3>
        <p>In the alpha and beta testing of Naras Nature, Naras Nature characters and 
          items cannot be advertised for sale, trade, or free outside the Natures Nature
          Discord server, Toyhouse world, or DeviantArt group. Any advertisements found 
          on third-party sites will result in a warning.
        </p>
        <p>Any use or mention of third parties within the group such as Toyhouse, 
          DeviantArt, Paypal, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky, etc. means the user 
          must comply with that third party site's Terms of Service at all times. Failure 
          to comply with third party Terms of Service may result in punishment similar to 
          violating Naras Nature's terms.
        </p>
        <p>As Naras Nature is a private species, users may not trade, sell, or gift Nara 
          designs, art, in-game currencies and items to users without a valid Naras Nature 
          account. On sites that allow for character and art commerce, 
          such as but not limited to: Toyhouse, DeviantArt, or Discord servers, Naras 
          Nature commodities cannot be advertised for sale without disclosing 
          the fact that both users must have a valid Naras Nature account. If found violating
          this rule, this will result in a strike.
        </p>
        
      <h2 id="rating">3.0 User Conduct & Content</h2>
      <p>Naras Nature is PG-13, and as such, conduct and content within the Naras Nature 
        community must be befitting of that parental guideline. This is to include users of all ages 
        13 and above, promoting a safe but open space. If you are unsure if you should mention 
        something or if your submission's content are allowed, feel free to send in a ticket or 
        ask the Celestials for more information.</p>
        
      <h3 id="notAllowed">3.1 Content not allowed in Naras Nature</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Heavy swearing. Light swearing within the Discord is allowed.</li>
          <li>Reclaimed slurs. As staff cannot verify the personal identities of users, we
            ask for users to refrain from using slurs, reclaimed or not.</li>
          <li>NSFW topics or art, which includes heavy gore, violence, sexual content, nudity, or 
            other graphic depictions.</li>
          <li>Promoting for or mentions of hard drugs or substance abuse. Mentions of alcohol or 
            recreational drug use are fine in art/writing depicitons or in passing conversation.</li>
            <li class="a">Mentioned in passing conservation does not allow for starting or 
              diverting conservation into explicit alcohol or drug use; examples:
            </li>
            <li class="a">Allowed: "We were drinking at my birthday party and I made the dumbest 
              decision." This conversation will be about the dumb decision, which may have been 
              caused by inebriation, but does not explicitly go on about alcohol use.</li>
            <li class="a">Allowed: "I had a weird experience with my co-worker. I think they were high, 
              but what they said was crazy." This passing mention is a possible excuse for this 
              co-worker's actions, but should not focus on their affected state.</li>
              <li class="a"">Not allowed: Explicit mentions of brands or types, routine mentions of 
              substance use, introducing substances, or creating an exclusive culture surrounding 
              substances with minors present.</li>
          <li>Religion, politics, or controversal topics.</li> 
            <li class="a">If a user politely asks to move on from 
              the topic, the users participating in the controversial topics must move on. If users 
              are deemed to be oppressing non-controversial topics, please send in a ticket to the 
              Naras Nature staff. In most cases, if users are uncomfortable with a topic, we ask to 
              move the topic outside of Naras Nature.</li>
          <li>Spam, such as copypastas, large walls of text, 'fancy' text, ghost pinging, etc.</li>
          <li>Any sort of speech, depiction, or bigortry that promotes hate or oppression, such as 
            but not limited to racism, transphobia, homophobia, or sexism.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3 id="community">3.2 Community Guidelines</h3>
      <p>On top of disallowed content, users of Naras Nature are expected to follow the following 
        community guidelines. By following this code of conduct, we aim to promote an inclusive and 
        fair space for all users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any drama or gossip about users in the group or others outside Naras Nature is discouraged. 
            If you have an issue with a user in the group or bring attention to an issue, please
            send in a ticket for review.</li>
          <li>Arguments or disagreements between users should be reported to staff so that we may resolve 
            it. If staff is not able to handle the conversation ASAP, users may ask the offending users to 
            move their conversation outside the server. Otherwise, please let Naras Nature Celestials handle 
            any disagreements.</li>
          <li>Voicing displeasure or passive-agressive behavior to any user or staff is not allowed. If 
            you suspect a user to be treating you or others in a disrespectful way, please screenshot 
            all instances and create a ticket with staff. Repeated instances of disrespectful behavior will 
            build a case, as Naras Nature respects those who may have different communication styles, and 
            do not want to miscontrue such cases.</li>
          <li>Cheating, foulplay, or exploiting loopholes is not allowed in any circumstance. We encourage 
            users to report any suspected activity. If you encounter an issue or the site incorrectly doles 
            out Naras Nature commodities, please report it.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <p>Depending on the severity most violations will first result in a warning. In subsequent 
        and repeated cases, a strike or suspension will be issued. Continued misconduct will result
        in a ban and termination of the user's account.
      </p>
      <p>Any sort of hate speech will result in an immediate ban. Naras Nature is a safe space that will 
        not tolerate bigotry.
      </p>

      <p>Some content is allowed in the Discord server, but should be hidden with the Spoil toggle 
        and appropriately labeled with a content warning (CW) accompanying the spoiled text/image. 
        This content includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Common phobias; including by not limited to:</li>
          <li id="a">Insects and insectoid designs</li>
          <li id="a">Medical topics & designs, and medical instruments such as needles</li>
          <li id="a">Body horror, such as exposed organs or candy gore</li>
          <li>Blood, weapons, or substances, including cartoonish depictions</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>

      <h2 id="acc">4.0 Your Naras Nature Account</h2>

        <u><a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2" target="_blank">
        OAuth2 <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></u>. This process 
        is the same as authorizing a Discord bot to your account. Through this process, 
        we expect your Discord account to comply with Discord's terms. Violating Discord's 
        age requirements will result in a ban from the group associated with that Discord 
        account.</p>

      <p>Please note, as our site verifies users by their Discord roles, leaving the Discord 
        server renders your account inaccessible. This is to ensure users comply with Naras 
        Nature's content rating and community values.
      </p>

        <h3 id="login">4.1 Information Accessed and Retained</h3>
        <p>By authorizing your Discord account on the Naras Nature site, we retain minimal 
          information about your Discord account for identification purposes.</p>

          purely for verification purposes in the Naras Nature ARPG. This information 
          is publicly available to all Discord users.</p>
        <p>The information we access is your Discord roles, to ensure you have been

        <p>We do not access or retain any other information from your Discord account.</p>

        <h3 id="accAllow">4.2 What you can do with your account</h3>

          outstanding strikes, suspensions, or bans.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="accDisallow">4.3 What you are not allowed do with your account</h3>
        <p>All users in Naras Nature, under any circumstances, may not do any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sell, trade, offer, gift, give away, or advertise Naras Nature designs, art, and 
            in-game currencies and items to users without a valid Naras Nature account. Advertisements
            will result in a warning, while any business done will result in a strike, suspension of 
            activities, or a ban depending on severity.
          </li>
            <li class="a">In the alpha and beta testing of Naras Nature, users may not do any of the

              not yet open to the public.
            </li>
          <li>Create or use alternate accounts on the Naras Nature site.</li>
            <li class="a">Alternate Discord accounts are allowed within the Discord server. To protect 
              against cheating with multiple accounts or accidental login on site, alternate Discord 
              accounts that have joined the Discord server must be introduced as such during verification. 
              That alternate account will be registered on site then marked as an alternate account to 
              prevent useage or accidental login on the Naras Nature site. 
            </li>
          <li>Create new accounts to bypass bans or suspensions.</li>
          <li>Violate the Terms of Service or any other laws and regulations that affect this website and 
            its users, including third-party terms of service that are affiliated with used within Naras 
            Nature.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="freeze">4.4 Account freezing</h3>
        <p>Users may request to freeze their Naras Nature account at any time. By freezing your account, 
          this means to hide your Naras Nature account from users on site. This does not permanently 
          freeze or delete your account, and can be undone anytime by sending in a new ticket. Accounts are never 
          deleted from site, but kept in the Naras Nature backend as an archive of all users that have 
          accessed Naras Nature. Freezing your account does not affect your participation or membership 
          in the Discord server. Account freezing must be requested within the Discord server by sending 
          in a ticket.</p>
        
        <p>By freezing your account, you cannot:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Participate in site activities.</li>
            <li>Obtain, create, or remove Nara commodities from your account.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Frozen accounts are different from banned accounts in that frozen accounts can resume activity 
          at any given time, if requested. Banned accounts cannot be unbanned nor allowed back in Naras Nature.
