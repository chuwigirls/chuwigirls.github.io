        <h1>Ascension</h1>

        <p id="pleft">As Naras train their magic, they may evolve and ascend into perfected forms, called 
          Ascensions, as their magic reaches new levels. Ascensions are similar to subspecies forms; each 
          Ascension has a common delineating feature, such as Mernaras with aquatic tails for the lower 
          half of their bodies or Nararousels having a pole bisect their torsos. And with the power of 
          Ascension, these forms grant bonuses in Quests and Magicomps, further enhancing a Nara's magic power.
        </p>
        
        <p id="pleft">The best explanation for Ascensions is that it is a power-upgrade, where Naras 
          have a base form, and Ascensions are achievable subspecies forms that grant Naras enhanced magic 
          abilities. These new physical forms grant the Nara an increase in their magical power, leveling up their 
          magic class every time it is depicted in a Quest, and granting the Nara extra points in Magicomps. 
        </p>

        <p id="pleft">While Ascensions are different forms, the vessel on a Nara will always stay the same. All 
          Ascensions also have a common delineating feature, marking them unique to that Ascension form. A 
          Mernara ascension will have the same vessel as the base Nara form, and some sort of aquatic 
          tail for the lower half of its body, just like a mermaid form. All other features can be changed; you 
          can simply give your Nara a mermaid tail, or make them into a leviathan
          must be the same throughout all 
          Ascensions, and the 
        </p>

        <p id="pleft">The most common ascension is the Humanara ascension, where a Nara takes on a mostly humanoid 
          form. While Humanara ascensions are free, all other ascensions require magic training and an 
          Artifact to ascend to. Ascensions prove that a Nara is on the road to mastering their magic class, 
          manifesting in a physical transformation that reflects their magical affinity. </p>
