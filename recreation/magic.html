            <i>Magic is a completely optional ARPG aspect of Naras Nature. 
            Participation grants extra rewards, but you are not missing out on 
            Naras Nature if you do not join.</i></p>

        <p>Once a week, you can train each of your Naras to level up their Magic class.</p>
        <p>Your Nara can train in one of the classes below: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elemental</li>
            <li>Divination</li>
            <li>Taming</li>
            <li>Magicraft</li>
            <li>Alchemy</li>
            <li>Deep arts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Elemental</h3>
        <p>Using their magic, a Nara can manipulate the elements in their surroundings. 
          These basic energies include the elements that make up an ecosystem, such as 
          fire, water, wind, and earth, or more complex compounds like ice, storms, botanics, 
          or gravity. Basic levels of elemental magic allow Naras to move and bend the existing 
          energies around them, while higher levels of mastery can convert the elements into 
          their barest energy signatures to be used at that Nara's whim. This means amateur
          Elementalists can move nearby sources such as rain summoning or air bending, while 
          trained Elementalists can combine several energies to be commanders of entire energy 
          systems, such as explosive steam engines with between fiery heat and water vapors, 
          or hurricanes that demand the command of wind, water, lightning. Mastery levels of 
          elementalism allow Naras to compress embers and static to breathe fire and throw 
          lightning, as if the Nara was born of the elements themselves.
        </p>

        <h3>Taming</h3>
        <p>Tamer Naras utilize their magic to create bonds with or summon creatures in the Nature, 
          allowing them to command these beings at will. Some Naras have rudimentary levels of 
          Taming magic to keep Palcharms and farm creatures, while truly dedicated Tamers can 
          capture and dangerous and powerful creatures 
        </p>

        <h3>Magicraft</h3>
        <p>Magicraft is the act of imbduing a Nara's own magic into talismans, runes, or other 
          objects, like creating another vessel that sits atop all Nara's heads. These enchanted 
          items can enact a variety of properties and spells, like cutesy placebo goodnight charms 
          for Narlings, stat-increased equipment for battle Naras, or complex mechanical devices 
          such as stoves, vehicles, and even golems. Magicraft can be combined with other magic 
          types to create powerful artifacts, such as channeling flames to burst forth from swords
          for Elemental Naras, magic tomes that grant foresight for Divine Naras, simple capture
          orbs for newbie Tamer Naras.
        </p>

        <h3>Alchemy</h3>
        <p>In the Nature, everything has its own magic signature, which can be read like a barcode 
          by Alchemists. By selecting and combining certain pieces of magic signatures, like a 
          ingredients in a recipe, Alchemist Naras can transmute seemingly unrelated items into 
          new creations. This magic type takes a massive amount of magic and practice, and only 
          masters of Alchemy can be truly self-sufficient after years of study. Otherwise, most 
          Alchemists are peddlers that travel for rare ingredients to fulfill requests for particularly 
          hard-to-procure or custom materials.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Divination</h3>
        <p>Divine magic is granted by others, instead of drawing from oneself or the surroundings.
          Divinity is usually bestowed by higher beings and authorities, but can manifest from 
          the collective emotions and willpower of Naras and creatures in the Nature, creating 
          what we call miracles. In its most basic forms, divine magic is used for healing, 
          fortune telling, and curing Abberated creatures. Divine Naras draw powers from higher or 
          other beings to magically recover wounds and Abberation, as well as receive prophecies and 
          connect astrological dots to foresee events. While Naras are not religious creatures, 
          the mystical power of healing and predictions are an undeniable force that defy expectations 
          and warrant its own magic type.
