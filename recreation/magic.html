            <i>Magic is a completely optional ARPG aspect of Naras Nature. 
            Participation grants extra rewards, but you are not missing out on 
            Naras Nature if you do not join.</i></p>

        <p>Once a week, you can train each of your Naras to level up their Magic class.</p>
        <h1>Magic classes</h1>
        <p>Your Nara can train in one of the classes below: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elemental</li>
            <li>Divination</li>
            <li>Taming</li>
            <li>Magicraft</li>
            <li>Alchemy</li>
            <li>Deep arts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Elemental</h3>
        <p>Using their magic, a Nara can manipulate the elements in their surroundings. 
          These basic energies include elements that make up an ecosystem, such as 
          fire, water, wind, and earth, or more complex compounds like ice, storms, botanics, 
          or gravity. Basic levels of elemental magic allow Naras to move and bend the existing 
          energies around them, while higher levels of mastery can convert the elements into 
          their barest energy signatures to be used at that Nara's whim. This means amateur
          Elementalists can move nearby sources such as rain summoning or air bending, while 
          trained Elementalists can combine several energies to be commanders of entire energy 
          systems, such as explosive steam engines that combine fiery heat and water vapors, 
          or hurricanes that demand the command of wind, water, lightning. Mastery levels of 
          elementalism allow Naras to compress embers and static to breathe fire and throw 
          lightning, as if the Nara was born of the elements themselves.
        </p>

        <h3>Taming</h3>
        <p>Tamer Naras utilize their magic to create bonds with or summon creatures, commanding
          other beings or living alongside them. Taming is split into two distinct styles: 
          using the magic within a Nara to forge a magical contract, or executing rituals and 
          creating magic circles to conjure creatures from the Nature. Contract magic allow Naras 
          to forge bonds with existing creatures, such as contracting Palcharms or farm creatures. 
          On the contrary, conjuring summons entirely new creatures into the Nature, using the 
          ritual ingredients to meld into a new creature that do not exist without that Nara's 
          magic power.
        </p>

        <h3>Magicraft</h3>
        <p>Magicraft is the act of imbduing a Nara's magic into talismans, runes, or other 
          objects, just like the vessel that sits atop all Nara's heads. These enchanted 
          items can enact a variety of properties and spells, like cutesy placebo goodnight charms 
          for Narlings, stat-increased equipment for battle Naras, or complex mechanical devices 
          such as appliances, vehicles, and even golems. Magicraft can be combined with other magic 
          classes to create powerful artifacts, such as channeling flames to burst forth from swords
          for Elemental Naras, magic tomes that grant foresight for Divine Naras, simple capture
          orbs for newbie Tamer Naras.
        </p>

        <h3>Alchemy</h3>
        <p>In the Nature, everything has its own magic signature, which can be read like a barcode 
          by Alchemists. By selecting and combining certain pieces of magic signatures, like a 
          ingredients in a recipe, Alchemist Naras can transmute seemingly unrelated items into 
          new creations. This magic class takes a massive amount of magic and practice, and only 
          masters of Alchemy can be truly self-sufficient after years of study. Otherwise, most 
          Alchemists are peddlers that travel for rare ingredients, fulfilling requests in exchange
          for hard-to-procure or custom materials to advance their studies.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Divination</h3>
        <p>Divine magic is granted by others, instead of drawing from oneself or the surroundings.
          Divinity is usually bestowed by higher beings and authorities, but can manifest from 
          the collective emotions and willpower of Naras and creatures in the Nature, creating 
          what we call miracles. In its most basic forms, divine magic is used for healing, 
          fortune telling, and curing Abberated creatures. Divine Naras draw powers from higher or 
          other beings to magically recover wounds and Abberation, as well as receive prophecies and 
          connect astrological dots to foresee events. While Naras are not religious creatures, 
          the mystical power of healing and predictions are an undeniable force that defy expectations 
          and warrant its own magic class.
        </p>

        <h3>Deep Arts</h3>
        <p>The hidden magic class that studies Abberated creatures. This class is not freely available to 
          study, due to the danger of exposure to corrupted Abberated creatures. As Abberated beings can 
          be purified by Divine magic, the study of Deep Arts is considered eccentric or even taboo. It's 
          unknown which Naras choose to study the Deep Arts, as the only known practitioners are those 
          who have been cured of Abberation themselves, and thus study this field to prevent their curse 
          reversal. Read more about Abberation <a href="/explore/abberation.html">here.</a>
