          <p><i>Quests</i> are a combination of prompts and questlines to 
            complete for rewards or personal character development. 
            Most Quests are completely optional; you do not have to complete 
            Quests, except Narlings evolution Quests, to participate in Naras 
            Nature. Rewards range from crystals, Palcharms, emblems, features,
            and more!
          <p><u>Why should you do a Quest?</u> All Quests award additional 
            crystals on top of regular crystal 
            Currency costs. For example, if you draw a fullbody for a Quest, 
            it will net you the regular 25 <img src="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/thumbnails/041/643/035/small_2x/holographic-geomatry-shapes-abstract-gradient-color-icon-png.png?" style="width:20px;"> 
            on top of any additional rewards given out by that Quest.
            Why not draw your Nara in a Quest and get that sweet extra crystals?</p>
          <p>Emblems are cosmetic badges to embellish your Nara's 
            masterlist. Some can award additional Crystals when the Nara it is 
            equipped to is used in other Quests or recreational activities. 
            When depicting multiple Naras in an Emblem 
            submission, only the Naras that are the main subjects and follow 
            that Quest's requirements will be rewarded the Emblem.</p>
          <p>Each Quest will have its own requirements. Some must be done 
            in consecutive order, may be done more than once, require another 
            Nara or need a specific feature. Depiction requirements are low to 
            encourage creativity in your Quests; perhaps it would be better 
            to show your Nara's head peeking out the water for their swimming 
            hobby, or a halfbody shot of your Nara's legs and weapon standing 
            over a monster corpse for a Hunting emblem, rather than force a 
            fullbody or long word count. If you have any questions about a 
            Quest, please ask in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/735233356169740329/735292632862818314" target="_blank"><u>

            <h4><u>Tag breakdown:</u></h4>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Prompt Quests</b> have simple themes meant to inspire 
                you on how to depict your Nara. These Quests are usually 
                standalone and do not have entry requirements. Some may 
                only occur for a period of time, like quick flash prompts 
                or recurring holiday events.</li>

              <li><b>Questline Quests</b> are groups of Quests that can be 
                done to evolve or enlighten your Nara. These Quests are meant 
                to build upon your Nara's lore and for character development. 
                Like a chain of quests, these Quests are related and may build 
                upon each other, requiring greater effort but reaping greater 
                rewards. You may only receive rewards once all of the Quests 
                in a questline have been completed, unlike one-time entry prompt Quests.</li>

              <li><b>Evolution Quests</b> must be completed for Narlings to 
                evolve and to use them in all aspects of Naras Nature, including 
                other Quests. Full-fledged Naras can do these Quests at any time 
                as well. Any Naras depicted in an approved Narling form in these Quests can earn an additional 5 Crystals. (EXPAND MORE)</li>

              <li><b>Eternal Quests</b> have no end date and can be done at any time.</li>

              <li><b>Ephemeral Quests</b> are small Quests that pop up and appear only for a short time. They may not return, or make rare, unplanned comebacks.</li>

              <li><b>Seasonal</b> Quests occur during certain parts of the year, or occur on a schedule and have planned comebacks.</li>

              <li>Quests with the <i>Feature</i> or <i>Emblem</i> tags grants those rewards besides Crystals.</p></li>
