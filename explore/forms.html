Nara
The most basic form, as called a feral or quadruped form.

Narling
The baby form of Naras. This forms uses fundamental features before they evolve to have the more familiar Nara features. Narling forms can be obtained with just a Summoning Scroll, or designed for a full-fledged Nara via the Back in my Narling days... pursuit.

Furry/Anthro
Also known as upright or bipedeal. Naras adopted these forms after humans visited the Nature. Not to be confused with the Posture feature, which does not grant an upright anthromorphized posture. Furry/anthro forms are acceptable for design approvals.

Humanoid
Also known as kemonomimi or animal-eared humans. Naras further developed these forms after interacting with humans. All humanoid Naras have at least a vessel, ribbons, and a tail from their furry forms. Other features, such as wings, container bodies, scales, etc, can be depicted up to their digression. Ribbons tend to be from any hair on the head, ears, facial hair, and from the tail. Humanoid forms are acceptable for design approvals.

Human
Completely human in appearance, Naras use magic to mask their features and disguise themselves. A Nara may venture into the human realm with this form, use it to welcome human guests, or simply for prankster purposes. Human forms can be obtained via the Hello human! pursuit.
